# Project-017
Animal Dung2Power Projects Chhatisgarh, Rajasthan, India

The small scale project activities involve the installation of 9 independent biogas digesters between
the 200 m3 and 2000 m3
capacity range, for serving the captive electricity needs at the location of
the project activities. Fresh cattle dung is fed into the anaerobic digesters.


The GHG emission reductions were calculated on the basis of UCR Biogas Protocol Standard
Baseline which draws reference from AMS.I.C.: Thermal energy production with or without
electricity and AMS-III.D: Methane recovery in animal manure management systems. 

SQAC is able to certify that the emission reductions from the “Small Scale Cattle Biogas to Power
Projects in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Karnataka, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Kerala and Haryana, India” for
the period 01/01/2018 to 31/10/2021 amount to 1,43,945 CoUs.

Detailed Verification Report:

Purpose:

The Small Scale Cattle Biogas to Power Projects in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Karnataka, West Bengal,
Chhattisgarh, Kerala and Haryana, India is located across the following Districts: Hisar, Dhanera,
Palanpur, Kheda, Seekar, Hoogly, Tumkur, Trivendrum and Raipur, State: Gujarat, Rajasthan,
Karnataka, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Kerala and Haryana, Country: India.
The small scale project activities involve the installation of 9 independent biogas digesters between
the 200 m3 and 2000 m3
capacity range, for serving the captive electricity needs at the location of
the project activities. Fresh cattle dung is fed into the anaerobic digesters.

In the absence of the project activity, animal manure is left to decay anaerobically within the project
boundary and methane is emitted to the atmosphere. The project activity recovers and utilizes
biogas for producing electricity for captive use and hence displaces electricity from the grid using
fossil fuels. The project activity hence avoids CH4 and CO2 emissions and is beneficial to the
environment and community
